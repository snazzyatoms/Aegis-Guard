🧑‍💻 Coding Guidelines

Keep code clean, minimal, and organized (≤10 main Java files is the target).

Use clear section headers so features are easy to find and modify.

Keep methods short and descriptive.

Always test changes on a Paper/Spigot server before submitting.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies — AegisGuard should remain lightweight.

Match the existing style and formatting in the project.
